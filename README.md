# ⚛️ Atomic SafeDrop

**Never lose your best gear to a misclick again.**

We’ve all been there: you’re bridging over a lava lake in the Nether or dodging attacks in the End, and a sudden slip of the finger makes you yeet your fully enchanted Netherite sword into the abyss. 

**Atomic SafeDrop** is a lightweight, strictly focused mod that elegantly solves this exact pain point without cluttering your game with unnecessary menus or bloated code.

### ✨ How It Works

SafeDrop acts as a smart safety net for your most precious items:
* **Valuables are Protected:** If the item you are holding is **enchanted** or has a **custom name**, the single drop key input is completely ignored. 
* **Intentional Dropping:** To actually drop a valuable item, you simply **double-tap the drop key** within a 500ms window.
* **Normal Behavior for Junk:** Standard items like dirt, cobblestone, or basic tools drop normally with a single press, ensuring your inventory management speed isn't slowed down.
